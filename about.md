I'm an italian student at Universit√† degli studi di Verona.
My area of interest is malware detection with focus on Android's threats.
Most posts will be on Android security, attacks etc. but the idea is to keep it open to any kind of security topic.
I will try to be always active and write something at least every two weeks.
I am currently developing an anti malware tool for Android and hopefully it will be available soon for testing on my github page and in the future as an Android app on main app stores.
For any info, bugs on the website, new projects or whatever, don't be shy and drop me a line :)


I'm really bad at web development and without some open source project I would not be able to make this blog. Thanks to:
+ [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) that gives the ability to develope light and fast websites
+ [Hydeout](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout) for the UI
+ [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting the blog for free
